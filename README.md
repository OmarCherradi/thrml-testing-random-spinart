# thrml-testing-random-spinart
A simple thermodynamic “spin art” generator using THRML and JAX.  This project builds a 2D Ising model and samples it to create emergent patterns.

# Exploring thermodynamic computation with a generative Ising model
This project uses THRML, a frontier thermodynamic computing library, to generate “spin art” which is a emergent pattern produced by sampling from a 2D Ising model.
Instead of traditional neural networks, THRML models systems as energy landscapes and performs computation by relaxation, sampling, and thermodynamic dynamics. This tiny experiment demonstrates how structure can emerge naturally from simple physical rules.
